# Print Design Portfolio


By [Phil Worthington](https://github.com/philworthington).


## Description
This is a website for my print design portfolio. It utilizes a one-page layout with jquery masonry in use as the primary structural component of the featured projects. Other javascript such as animate on scroll, localScroll, and scrollTo are also used throughout. Featuring HTML5 and CSS3 for subtle animations.
